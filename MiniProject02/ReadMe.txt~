This project uses all the standard setup as the rest of the few past excesses. By pressing the button, this trips the an interrupt that cycles a mode the determines the behavior of the rest of the inputs and outputs. Mode 0 simply toggles a GPIO, sets a PWM out, and reads the ADC voltage. Mode 1 used the ADC or the pot connected to set the frequency of the PWM, while Mode 2 allows the same to be done for the duty cycle. Mode 3 prints the current temp as updated from the I2C temp sensor. The main while loop has a timer component that executes every 3 seconds if a timeout accrues, and while quite the loop and reset the GPIOs before exiting when the user sends a Ctrl C command. The proper example of calling the function would be: “./a.out 7 60 3 75 0” where 7 and 60 are the GPIO input and output, 3 is the third I2C bus, 75 is the address for the temp sensor, and 0 is the address of the register on the I2C device to be read.
